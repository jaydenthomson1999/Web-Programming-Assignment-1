# Web-Programming-Assignment-1
You are required to build the server and front end for a chat system. For assignment 1, chat functionality is not required, you will be building the dashboard for the chat system, and in assignment 2 you will add the chat functionality along with other features. The chat system will allow users to communicate with each other in real-time within different groups and channels. Some users will have admin permission to add users to channels and groups, whilst a super admin has access to the entire site. The solution must be implemented using Node.js, Angular, and sockets. No user authentication is required for assignment 1.
